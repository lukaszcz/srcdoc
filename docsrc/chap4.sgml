<para>

With the <option>-d</option> or <option>--dependencies</option>
command line option SrcDoc parses first the files on which a given
file depends. Documentation is also generated for these files. If the
exact path of the file is not specified within the module which
depends on it, then the file is searched with various extensions in
the <link linkend="src_path">source search path</link>. If the file is
not found it is silently ignored.

</para>
<para>

Files included using {$i ... } are not taken into account when parsing
dependencies.
