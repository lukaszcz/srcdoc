<title>Basic comment formatting</title>
<para>

A comment must be placed just before the declaration which it
describes. By default, adjoining comments separated only be whitespace
are joined into one comment. This behaviour may be controlled by the
--join-comments command line switch. See <link
linkend="cmdlineOptions">command line options</link>.

</para>
<para>

Comments may be formatted by means of comment-commands. A
comment-command starts with '@' followed by the command name. Command
names are not case-sensitive. 

</para>
<para>

If no commands are present in the whole comment, then the comment is
simply written under the heading 'Description'. By default, the first
sentence is used as the synopsis. The synopsis may be also specified
by the <link linkend="cmdSynopsis">@synopsis</link> command.

</para>
<para>

Commands may be divided into three groups: section commands, inline
commands and comment-start commands.

</para>
<para>

 Section commands begin a new section - typically a new
paragraph. Everything after a section command falls into the new
section. The old one is finished. If an unknown command is
encountered, a warning is issued and a new section is started with the
name of the unrecognized command, capitalized and with '-' and '_'
changed into space, as the heading for the section.

</para>
<para>

One of the most common section commands is probably the @see
command. It begins a new section of whitespace- or comma-separated
names of identifiers, which are displayed as links under the heading
'See also'.

</para>
<para>

Inline commands appear inside a section and don't terminate it. Two of
these commands are, for instance, @code and @end-code. These two
commands are used to indicate that the text between them is a program
code.

</para>
<para>

Comment-start commant are interpreted only if they appear at the very
start of the comment. The '@' character must be the first character of
the comment. There are currently only two such commands: @discard,
which causes the comment to be discarded, and @decl, which makes the
rest of the comment be treated like a declaration.

</para>
<para>

Comment-start commands, in contrast to the other two flavours of
commands, apply only to one comment as found in a source file,
regardless of whether adjoining comments are to be joined or not.

</para>
<para>

It is worth noting that if you place an ordinary command at the very
beginning of the comment, it will be tried to be interpreted as a
comment-start command and an error will occur.
