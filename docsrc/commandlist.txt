--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A list of commands recognized by SrcDoc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

   Arguments may be passed to commands in two ways. The first one is
to enclose the whole command list in braces ("(" and ")") and separate
the arguments with commas. In this case, the leading whitespace before
each argument are removed. Starting from the first non-whitespace
character up to ")" or "," every character is then considered to be a
part of the argument, including whitespace. We shall call the
arguments passed in this way explicit arguments. The second way is
just to write the arguments after the command name separating them
with whitespace. In this approach, however, the number of the
following words interpreted as arguments is precisely defined by the
command. That is, depending on the command, different numbers of
subsequent words are considered to be arguments. We shall call the
arguments passed in this way implicit arguments.

   The notation @cmd arg1 arg2 ... argN means that the command cmd
takes exactly N implicit arguments. These arguments may be as well
passed as explicit arguments. The notation @cmd(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)
means that the command cmd takes exactly N explicit arguments. These
arguments cannot be passed as implicit arguments.

   All commands are case-insensitive.

Alphabetical list of commands


<xxx>

     Indicates that xxx is a name of some local symbol (ex. a routine
     parameter). xxx must be a single word and may contain no
     whitespace.

_xxx_

     Makes xxx emphasised. See @emphasis.

\<char>

     If <char> is one of '_', '<', '>', '@' or '\' then escapes it,
     i.e. prevents it from being specially interpreted by the comment
     parser. '@' may also be escaped by another '@'.

@<xxx>

     Creates a link to xxx. See @link.

@c
@code

     Makes the subsequent text be interpreted as source code and
     formatted accordingly. See @end-code.

@discard-subsequent-commands
@discard-commands

     Discards all the commands after the current position. In other
     words, interprets every subsequent @ character as a normal
     character.

@discard-recent-comment
@discard-recent-comments
@discard-comment

     Discards the part of the comment before the current position.

@e <word>
@emp <word>
@emphasis <word>
@emphasis(text)

     Makes <word> or <text> emphasised. <word> may not contain
     whitespace and must be composed of alpha-numeric characters
     entirely. <text> may contain anything except for ',' and ')'.

@ec
@end-code

     If @code is active then deactivates it. Otherwise does nothing.

@fetch-related

     Fetches a comment from a related method and prepends it to the
     current comment. A related method is a method in an ancestor
     class or an implemented interface or its ancestor with the same
     name as the current method.

@heading one_word_heading size
@heading(heading, size)
@heading(heading)

     Makes <heading> appear as a heading of size <size>. <size> may be
     a number form 1 (the largest) to 6 (the smallest). If the size is
     omitted then uses the size number 3.

@ignore-declarations n

     Ignores n following declarations. Comments are read and processed
     normally, and if one of the following comment includes an
     @include-declarations command it overrides the effect of the
     previous command.

@include-declarations n

     Indicates that the current comment is a common comment for n
     following declarations.

@id name
@identifier name
     
     Interprets <name> as a programming language identifier and
     formats it accordingly.

@kw arg
@keyword arg

     Indicates that the argument arg is a language keyword. It will be
     formatted accordingly.

@link dest
@link(dest,label)

     Creates a link to <dest>. <dest> should be the name of an
     identifier, either qualified or not. If <dest> is not recognized
     as a valid symbol then the link is written as a plain text. The
     text on the link is <label> if the second argument is present.

@linkfile dest
@linkfile(dest,label)
@lf dest
@lf(dest,label)

     Creates a link to a file named <dest>. Causes the documentation
     to be generated for this file as well.

@nl
@newline

     Insert a line break.

@no-description

     Inhibits the automatic generation of the description paragraph
     for the current comment.

@para
@para(heading)

     Starts a new paragraph without a heading or with <heading> as a
     heading. When starting a new paragraph text formatting options
     are reset to their defaults.

@param param_name [-] param_description...

     Declares a parameter to a routine. param_name is the name of the
     parameter, followed by an optional dash (-), followed by the
     description of the parameter, which is a text block of any length
     continuing up to the next non-inline command or the end of the
     comment.

@pre ... @endpre

     Declares a pre-formatted text block. Anything between the @pre
     and @endpre commands is written to the output file exactly as it
     appears in the comment. No formatting, beautifying or even not
     the interpretation of commands is performed. The only recognized
     command after encountering @pre is @endpre.

@profile <profile_name>
@profile(<profile_names>)
@profiles(<profile_names>)

     Indicates that _all_ of the declarations that will be associated
     with the comment should be written out only in the listed
     profiles. If this appears in the unit comment then the
     documentation for the whole unit is created only in the listed
     profiles. There are two predefined profile names: 'user' and
     'devel'. To exclude the declaration from all profiles use
     '@profile none'. Profile names are not case-sensitive.

@see [block]
     
     Begins a new paragraph with the heading 'See' and creates a link
     to each word in [block]. Discards any non-alphanumerical
     characters in [block].

@synopsis [block]

     Declares the synopsis for the current comment to be [block]. If
     there is no @synopsis command in the whole comment and the
     --synopsis command line option is on (the default), then the
     first sentence of the comment is assumed to be the synopsis,
     provided that it is not too long.

@title(title)

     Sets the title for the comment. If this appears in a file whose
     only content is a comment then this sets the name by which the
     file is referred to in the auto-generated contents. Otherwise, it
     might or might not have any effect depending on the output format
     and the size of the declaration/section associated with the
     comment.

@until-next-comment

     Indicates that the current comment is a common comment for all
     following declarations until another comment is encountered.


Comment-start Commands

These commands are interpreted only if they appear at the very
beginning of a comment. Not even a preceding sequence of whitespace is
allowed. The @ character must be the first character of the comment.

{@discard ... }

     Ignores the comment. Applies only to one, separate comment, even
     when comments are joined. For example, from the following two
     comments only the first one is ignored, even if adjoining
     comments are merged.

     {@discard A comment to ignore. }
     { This one is not ignored. }

{@decl <declaration> }

     The effect of this comment is that anything after it in the
     comment is treated af if it was outside a comment. It is often
     useful when a declaration in a descendant class is not
     overridden, but nonetheless needs a different description than
     that in the ancestor.
