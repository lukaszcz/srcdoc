<title>Profiles</title>
<para>

Depending on the intended audience, you may choose to include only the
interface parts of modules, or both the interface and implementation.

Profiles let you control which parts are written to output and which
are ignored. There are two pre-defined profiles:
<parameter>user</parameter> and <parameter>devel</parameter>. You may
also specify your own profile, but you will have to use options line
<option><link linkend="opt_protected">--protected</link></option> or
<option><link linkend="opt_private">--private</link></option>.

</para>
<para>

In the <parameter>user</parameter> profile only declarations present
in the interface are included in the documentation, and only public
and protected methods of classes. In the <parameter>devel</parameter>
profile every declaration is included.  

</para> 
<para> 

You may explicitly include or exclude a declaration by using the
<command><link linkend="cmd_profile">@profile</link></command> command
in the comment associated with the declaration. This command may be
followed by one profile name or a list of profile names in which the
declaration should be included. If there is more than one profile
name, then the list must be enclosed in parentheses and the left
bracket must follow immediately after the command name with no
intervening whitespace. If the <command><link
linkend="cmd_profile">@profile</link></command> command is not used
then whether to include the declaration is determined based on the
rules from the above paragraph.
