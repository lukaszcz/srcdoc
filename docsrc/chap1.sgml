<title>What is SrcDoc?</title>
<para>

SrcDoc is a program for creating source code documentation of programs
from comments in source files. In contrast to other similar programs
the comments need not even be formatted. However, they will certainly
look better if you apply some formatting.

The goal of SrcDoc is to support multiple programming languages and
multiple output formats. As of the current version, only Delphi/Pascal
input and HTML output are supported.

In addition to simply extracting comments and declarations, SrcDoc
generates class and interface trees, determines which classes
implement each interface and finds immediate descendants of each
class. It also automatically generates an index of symbols and a table
of contents for the whole documentation.
