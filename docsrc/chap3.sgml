<title>Invoking SrcDoc</title>
<para>

The simplest way to run SrcDoc is to type: <command>srcdoc
file</command>. This uses the default options, parses
<filename>file</filename> and writes output for it in the current
directory.

It should be noted that SrcDoc will refuse to parse any files whose
extensions it doesn't recognize. Currently recognized extensions are:
.pas, .pp, .p for Pascal or Delphi files, .txt .text for raw text
files, .srd and .comment for files containing comments only.

</para>
<para id="srcPath">

You may specify the output directory by passing -o DIR or
--output-directory=DIR as a command line parameter. The -s or
--source-directory parameters specify source directories, which are
added to the search path for source files. The current directory is in
the source search path by default, and if any of the input files is in
a directory different from the current one, this directory is also
added to the search path.
